Release notes for version 1.3

New Features:
 - Autorun option
 - Variable screen resolutions for OpenGL versions
 - More graphics for assassin weapons

Bug Fixes:
 - Demos now sync correctly
 - Backstab now works better
 - Smoother mouse for X11 and OpenGL

Notes:
  To use any resolution for OpenGL, run HHexenGL with the switches "-width"
 and "-height".  Of course, you must specify the width and height you want
 after the appropriate switch. Sorry, but for now the X11 version is 
 staying with the double-size pixels.
  Using the autorun feature is straightforward.  It can be turned on or off
 from the "Options" menu.  Note that this is a "proper" autorun, meaning that
 if you press the "Speed" key while autorun is enabled it will cause you to
 walk.  Also note that autorun will not be enabled if you are recording a demo.
  Demos now sync properly!  Much thanks to Krzysztof Nikiel for fixing this.
  I know that the graphics for the crossbow look terrible.  I plan on doing
 them over sometime.  If you have artistic talent and would like to draw some
 graphics or fix up some of the existing ones, I will gratefully accept your
 submission.
  One last thing: HHexen now uses the file hhexen.cfg to store its settings.
 The simplest way to preserve your settings is to rename your hexen.cfg file.
 If you don't, a new file will be created using HHexen's default settings. 
 This may not be ideal, since there is currently no way to change mouse buttons
 from within the game.
