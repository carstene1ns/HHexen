				 HHexen 1.5.0

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

				     About

This is a new release of Dan's excellent Hacked Hexen by the authors of
Hammer of Thyrion (Hexen II).  We're applying fixes and enhancements we have
and putting this port back in the wild so people can contribute to it again.

Major changes with this release since the previous 1.4 version, are:

  * OpenGL intermission and finale screens
  * Support for big endian and 64 bit machines
  * Fixed FreeBSD support
  * Various hacks/fixes for the proper handling of different 1.0 and 1.1
    wad file versions
  * OpenGL is the default configuration now
  * Incomplete assassin class is now disabled by default
  * Other usual bugfixes.
  * See ChangeLog for details.

				    Prereqs

There exist several versions of the hexen.wad file:

1.0 wads:
  b2543a03521365261d0a0f74d5dd90f0  hexen.wad (20,128,392 bytes)
  1077432e2690d390c256ac908b5f4efa  hexdd.wad (4,429,700 bytes)

1.1 wads:
  abb033caf81e26f12a2103e1fa25453f  hexen.wad (20,083,672 bytes)
  78d5898e99e220e4de64edaa0e479593  hexdd.wad (4,440,584 bytes)

Demo wad 1.0 (from PC shareware hexndemo.zip):
  876a5a44c7b68f04b3bb9bc7a5bd69d6  hexen.wad (10,644,136 bytes)

Demo wad 1.1 (from Macintosh shareware MacHexenDemo.hqx):
  925f9f5000e17dc84b0a6a3bed3a6f31  hexen.wad (13,596,228 bytes)

We did our best to support the old 1.0 wad files in HHexen 1.5, but we strongly
suggest that you always patch your wads to version 1.1 to avoid possible issues.
If, for some reason, patching is not an option and you run into problems, then
compile hhexen to specifically use version 1.0 hexen.wad:
  ./configure --enable-oldwad

Remember that saved games and recorded demos from different wad versions are not
compatible.

If you don't have the full retail version of Hexen, you can still play the demo
version.  We suggest that you download the demo wad from our site:  it is the
the 4-level version 1.1 demo wad file from the MacHexen shareware.  On the other
hand, the PC shareware wad is a version 1.0 wad and we don't recommend it. (If
you specifically want to use the PC demo and ordinary hhexen gives you trouble
with it, recompiling hhexen with the --enable-oldwad configuration might help.)

				   Compiling

You'll need SDL and SDL-devel packages installed.

To compile the OpenGL version (hhexen-gl):
	./autogen.sh
	./configure
	make

To compile the software version (hhexen-sdl):
	./configure --disable-gl
	make

To compile the software version (hhexen-svga, for the old-fashioned :)
	./configure --enable-svga
	make

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

				     Hints

While the game is running, you can switch to/from windowed/fullscreen rendering
by the ALT-Enter key combination.

You can double click with your mouse2 or mouse3 button and it will act as the
'activate' (use) key.

There is still no way to assign mouse buttons to actions in the control-setup
menu; it still needs some work.  Currently, the mouse buttons can still only be
assigned to a few actions:

  mouseb_fire    (fire)
  mouseb_strafe  (strafe)
  mouseb_forward (move forward)
  mouseb_jump    (jump)

which is done by editing $HOME/.hhexen/hhexen.cfg and changing these values.
Button values are:

  left   mouse button = 0
  middle mouse button = 1
  right  mouse button = 2
  unused              =-1

So, to make the right button jump, change the mouseb_jump line in hhexen.cfg,
like so:

  mouseb_jump 2

The add-on fourth class, Assassin, is not quite finished yet, and is disabled by
default.  It can be enabled with "configure --enable-assassin".  The precompiled
binaries with HHexen-1.5 do not have the assassin enabled.
*Warning*: There may be issues with the game saves made from assassin enabled
binaries and from those without.  Enemies have been noticed to disappear!
