HHexen ChangeLog

v1.5.x [2009-05-15]
 - added --with-datapath a new configure option. if not used, HHEXEN_DATAPATH
   is defined as an empty string, otherwise as the directory path given on the
   configure command line. if it isn't an empty string and the HHEXEN_DATA
   environment variable isn't found, the engine will export HHEXEN_DATAPATH as
   HHEXEN_DATA.
 - made sure that the HHEXEN_DATA environment variable, if found, isn't an empty
   string.
 - made default behavior of running windowed or fullscreen changable by configure.
   the default is running windowed, the --enable-fullscreen configure option makes
   fullscreen the default.

   documented the -file command line option. added the -file option to the help
   display.
