HHexen ChangeLog

v1.4.1
 - Added support for the Mac version of the demo hexen.wad file.
 - The demo wad files doesn't need a special configuration anymore.
 - Various hacks/fixes for the proper handling of different 1.0 and 1.1 wad
   file versions; read WADFILES for technical details.
 - Adding wad and lmp files: hhexen will now look in the user directory, too.
   Now, the search order is:
   (1) in directory specifed by the HHEXEN_DATA environment variable,
   (2) in the user directory (~/.hhexen/),  and
   (3) in the usual current directory (w/o any prefixes to the filename).
 - The recorded demos are now written in the user directory (~/.hhexen/).

   configure with --enable-assassin
